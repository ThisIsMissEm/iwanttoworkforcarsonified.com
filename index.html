    <h2>I&rsquo;m Micheil Smith,</h2>
    <p class="leader">an <abbr title="I turn 18 in the middle of october">almost 18 year old</abbr> web developer from Australia. I have a passion for typography, design, javascript and the web.</p>
    
    <p>I started developing for the web in 2006. In the time since then, I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with some excellent people &mdash; including <a href="http://johnfallsopp.com/" title="John Allsopp's personal site">John Allsopp</a>, <a href="http://wynnnetherland.com/" title="Wynn's personal site">Wynn Netherland</a>, and <a href="http://adamstacoviak.com/" title="Adam's website &amp; blog">Adam Stacoviak</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Over the past three years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in various community-oriented projects and groups. Most recently, I&rsquo;ve been a co-host of <a href="http://thechangelog.com" title="The Changelog Podcast episodes &amp; blog">The Changelog Podcast</a> and guest author on their blog. At the end of August, I helped out with the <a href="http://nodeknockout.com" title="NKO's website: A 48HR node.js hackathon">Node Knockout</a>. In september of 2009, I helped with the judging of the <a href="http://mcfarlaneprize.com" title="Website of the Australian prize for excellence in Web Design">McFarlane Prize</a> and will be doing the same this year in the next few weeks.</p>
    
    <p>I&rsquo;m currently completing my final year of high school, which I finish in the middle of November. In July of 2009, I started my Computer Science degree at <a href="http://csu.edu.au" title="The website of Charles Sturt University">Charles Sturt University</a>, where I was the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/csupressrelease" title="Press Release on the CSU website about me">youngest student</a> actively studying. I studied a single subject towards my degree, achieving a distinction in the subject.</p>
    
    <p>Presently, I am the 8th most regular <a href="http://github.com/ry/node/contributors" title="The contributors list of the Node.js project">contributor to Node.js</a>, working on a Rails powered application with Adam Stacoviak, and most of my spare time is spent working on other <a href="http://github.com/miksago" title="My Github profile">open-source projects</a>. Earlier this year, I worked with Wynn Netherland on two rubygems which implement Ruby APIs for two payment gateways &mdash; <a href="http://github.com/pengwynn/giact" title="The github project for the Giact Gem">Giact</a> and <a href="http://github.com/pengwynn/chargify" title="The github project for the Chargify Gem">Chargify</a>. Last year, I worked with <a href="http://uxebu.com/" title="Uxebu Consulting's website">Uxebu Consulting</a> and helped John Allsopp find resources for his book <a href="http://amzn.com/0321646924" title="The amazon.com page on John Allsopp's book"><em>Developing With Web Standards</em></a>. Prior to that, I worked with various designers and developers on smaller projects. For the complete list of qualifications &amp; employers, please refer to my <a href="http://static.brandedcode.com/resume.pdf" title="A pdf of my r&eacute;sum&eacute;">r&eacute;sum&eacute; (&#8202;pdf&#8202;)</a>.</p>
